Team project learning and implementing sorting algorithms in C language

This is a group project done by Stephanie Olulesho & Iliya Damina

Here, concepts like

1. Bubble sort
1. Insertion sort
1. Selection sort
1. Quick sort
1. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence
1. Cocktail shaker sort
1. Counting sort
1. Merge sort
1. Heap sort
1. Radix sort
1. Bitonic sort
1. Quick Sort - Hoare Partition scheme
1. Sorting a deck of cards.

Are looked into and solved. 
All these sorting algorithms have their respective prototypes in the functions defined.

A directory sorting_algorithms is used for this project.
